# birthday-invites

This python project will help you prepare invitations.

All you need to do is go to 'Input' folder then to 'Names' folder and write names one under the other.

Ready invitations will appear in 'Output' -> 'ReadyToSend'.

You can modify your invitation in 'Input' -> 'Letters' -> 'starting_letter.txt' but remember to leave [name] where you want the name from your list to appear.
